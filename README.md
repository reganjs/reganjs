I enjoy learning new technologies, meeting new people, and creating content! Below is a bit about me as a person, what I enjoy outside of web development, and my story. My story is a brief description of how I got into the Tech Industry from a non-traditional path. 

### allAboutMe.js

```javascript
const aboutMe = {
    pronouns: "he" | "him",
    code: [Javascript, Python, C++, Ruby on Rails],
    tools: [GitHub, Git, StackOverflow, Discord, Slack, JIRA, Chrome DevTools],
    ide: [Pycharm, Visual Studio Code, Atom],
    frontend: [HTML5, CSS3, jQuery]
    extra: [MongoDB, MySQL, SQL, Chai, Selenium, Mocha, NODE, React]
    hobbies: {
                   sports: ["Golf", "Tennis", "Fishing", "Badminton"],
                   other:  ["Cooking", "Coding", "Photography"],
                                                                           },
    challenge: "I am focusing on improving my coding skills for 2022. I will be attempting to write code once per day for 300+ days this year."
```

### Here is a bullet list of things I do to keep busy when I'm not studying or coding:

- üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Taking a break from work to write on Medium! Located in Calgary, AB.
- üêï Taking my Golden Doodle STRUDEL on walks. She is a handful.
- üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Working on my golf swing. No seriously, this is a full-time job all by itself.
- üçΩ Trying new restauraunts or cafes. I love coffee and most types of cuisine! I also spend a lot of time cooking.

<h3>My Story</h1>

I spent the early years of my career working in the railway industry as a conductor. I often found myself going to work at 02:00 AM with little sleep and 12 work hours ahead of me. Eventually, after a few gruelling years I interviewed as a Rail Traffic Controller at a Railway Company I was working at. Shortly after my interview I received a phone call from another company for a position that would have me working as an IT Support Analyst. I took it! I left the railway industry behind and took a drastic pay cut to learn about IT. It wasn't easy but let me tell you, it was worth it. Fast forward to 2021. I quit my job as an IT Analyst during the Great Resignation and I accepted a new position as a Technical Lead. I enrolled in LHL's Full-Stack Web Development program and am now currently honing my development skills. I'm looking forward to creating mobile applications for my current company this Fall season of 2022. Afterwards I look forward to learning about Data Engineering and Blockchain Development. What a ride it's been!

If you're an aspiring Software Engineer, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
