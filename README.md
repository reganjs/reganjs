👋🏻 Hello, everyone, happy to meet you!

👨🏻‍💻 I am the Technical Lead at Measur and an aspiring Full-Stack Software Engineer. I work with large enterprise grade drones and UAVS on a daily basis. Seeing as I work with drones, I am also a licensed RPAS Advanced Pilot. I get to fly large drones like the Trinity F90+ and DJI Matrice RTK 300. I mainly provide IT services to the company that I work at but I also create technical documentation, host technical webinars, provide IT support, and train co-workers and customers on IT practices. I hope to begin coding more mobile applications in the Fall of 2022! 

✍🏻 I am studying at Lighthouse Labs so I can create my own mobile applications. I am taking their Full-Stack Software Engineer program.
