My story: 

I spent the early years of my career working in the railway industry as a conductor. I often found myself going to work at 02:00 AM with little sleep and 12 work hours ahead of me. Eventually, after a gruelling few years I interviewed as a Rail Traffic Controller at a Railway Company I was working at. Shortly after my interview I received a phone call from another company for a position that would have me working as an IT Support Analyst. I took it! I left the railway industry behind and took a drastic pay cut to learn about IT. It wasn't easy but let me tell you, it was worth it. Fast forward to 2021. I quit my job as an IT Analyst during the Great Resignation and I accepted a new position as a Technical Lead. I enrolled in LHL's Full-Stack Web Development program and am now currently honing my development skills. I'm looking forward to creating mobile applications for my current company this Fall season of 2022. Afterwards I look forward to learning about Data Engineering and Blockchain Development.

If you're an aspiring Software Engineer, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I regularly review resumes and LinkedIn profiles. I'd be happy to help you and answer any questions you may have.
